# File-Icons-Types package

- File icons similar to the vscode-icons pack for Visual Studio Code (https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons) built off of the logo-file-icons pack (https://atom.io/packages/logo-file-icons) with tweaks and additions
- Tree view ui tweeks to closer match that of visual studio code

## Roadmap
* Add new icons
I will probably no longer push major updates with breaking changes, but I will continue to merge PRs, settle issues, add icons and patches (a few icons don't need a major update).
